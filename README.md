## 🧠 Algorithms Used
We implemented and analyzed multiple algorithms for solving different aspects of the transportation optimization problem:

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: To compute the shortest paths between nodes (city intersections).
- **Prim's Algorithm**: For building a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to reduce infrastructure costs.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: As an alternative MST algorithm to compare efficiency and performance.
- **A* Search Algorithm**: For efficient pathfinding using heuristics, especially in large graphs.
- **Greedy Strategy**: Applied for designing optimized bus routes based on coverage and distance heuristics.

## 💻 Language & Tools
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse  
- **Visualization**: Console outputs and structured data representation

## ⚙️ System Functionality
- Accepts graph input of the city's roads and intersections
- Calculates shortest travel times between critical points
- Builds minimum-cost connection maps
- Suggests optimal bus routes based on city map
- Offers comparative analysis between algorithms

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
For each algorithm used, we discussed the time and space complexities, and explained the rationale behind choosing them for specific tasks.
